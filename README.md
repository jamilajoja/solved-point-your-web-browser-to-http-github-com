How did you reach this conclusion?Is the project still being actively developed? How can you tell?When did this project start? How can you tell?Your report should include a link to the repository home page.Be sure to cite any reference sources that you use for this report.2.)In this module we looked at producing documentation without any special tools or software. This is fine for developers but a real software project needs more than that.Do some research on tools that are designed to help create software documentation (text and images) and write up a 2-3 page report on a subset of them that you would recommend for your company project. Be sure to give details on their use and why they were selected, in addition to what benefits they can provide.Also be sure to cite any reference sources that you use for this report.
